<h1>HOW TO PLAY MATCH THREE </h1>
<h2>Objective and Rules </h2>
<p1>
   Swap tiles to make matches of 
   
   three (or more) of a kind. These matches may be horizontal or

   vertical. Each match and resulting cascade of matches (if you're lucky) scores you points!

   You have 30 moves to score as many points as possible. You

   may only move a tile if that move ensures at least a three-tile match.

   <h2> CONTROLS </h2>

   <p1>Use your cursor to select your desired tile. It will become outlined in Orange.

     <br>

     Once you have selected your tile, click on the tile with which you

     want to swap.

     <br>
     Press New Game to play again, or reset the game.
